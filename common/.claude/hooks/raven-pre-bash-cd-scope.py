"""PreToolUse hook: once per session, name the absolute-path rewrite for a leading ``cd``.

``cd <dir> && <cmd>`` makes a command's meaning depend on state that is not in
the command. In an agent harness the working directory is reset between tool
calls, so the ``cd`` buys nothing that a path argument would not, and every
later reader of the transcript has to reconstruct where the command ran. The
same shape also defeats static analysis of what a command will read: Claude
Code 2.1.259 escalates it with "would search a directory that cannot be
determined here". That escalation is the symptom that prompted this hook, but
it is not the reason for it -- the determinism argument holds whatever upstream
does with its permission analysis, and this hook should outlive the 2.1.259
behavior either way (jpease/raven#260).

Deliberately narrow. It fires only when the command after the ``cd`` is
read-only *and* already takes a path operand, so a mechanical rewrite always
exists: ``git`` (``git -C <dir> ...``) and the search/read tools in
``_PATH_TAKING``. ``just``, package managers, build tools, and anything that
resolves config from the working directory are left alone, because for those
the ``cd`` is correct. A matcher broad enough to catch every case would fire on
legitimate work and be tuned out within a day, which turns a control back into
a prompt -- the failure this exists to fix.

Advisory, not a denial, and once per session -- the same two choices
``raven-pre-bash-test-scope.py`` makes, for the same reason: the rewrite is
usually right, not always, and a nudge repeated on every call is noise. Whether
once is enough is an open question the ``absolute-path-search`` eval scenario
is there to answer; escalating to a denial is a decision for that measurement,
not for this docstring.

Shared byte-for-byte between the Claude and Codex adapters: both deliver
``hookSpecificOutput.additionalContext`` from a PreToolUse command hook, and
both put ``session_id`` in the payload. The stamp lives under the temp
directory, never in the repository. No ``session_id`` means no stamp and
therefore no nudge, rather than a nudge on every command.
