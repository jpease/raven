"""PreToolUse hook: deny destructive bash commands (rm -rf /, git reset --hard, dropdb, ...).

Every rule reasons about a tokenized command rather than its raw text: the
program is resolved past wrappers and environment assignments, options are
normalized so `-rf`, `-fr` and `--recursive --force` are one intent, payloads
handed to a nested interpreter are followed, and heredoc bodies that are data
rather than code are dropped.

Matching raw text instead is both noisier and leakier. It fires on any mention
-- a search pattern, a commit message, a line of documentation -- while missing
the ordinary spellings that put an option between a verb and its object, so
`kubectl -n default delete deployment` reads as harmless. Claude Code documents
the same fragility for its own Bash permission patterns.
